parameters :
    fasta_file :
        ui-name : FASTA File Path
        short-hint : FASTA File containing assembled contigs or chromosomes (NOT feature sequences)
        long-hint  : |
                Valid file extensions for FASTA: .fasta, .fna, .fa; Compressed files (containing files with vaild extentions): .zip, .gz, .bz2, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2. Note that the FASTA file must contain sequences for contigs which match the seq_id in the gff file not sequences for every individual feature.

    gff_file :
        ui-name : GFF3 File Path
        short-hint : GFF3 File containing list of predicted gene models and associated features
        long-hint  : |
                Valid file extensions for GFF: .gff, .gff3. Compressed files (containing files with valid extensions): .zip, .gz, .bz2, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2. Note that older versions of GFF files may also have the .gff extension but have a differing schema which could result in incorrect upload. Always use GFF3 where possible

    genome_name :
        ui-name : Metagenome Object Name
        short-hint : Provide a name for the output object that will be created by this upload
        long-hint  : Provide a name for the output object that will be created by this upload

    # metagenome_type:
    #     ui-name: Metagenome Type
    #     short-hint : The type or source of this metagenome
    #     long-hint  : The type or source of this metagenome

    # scientific_name :
    #     ui-name : Scientific Name
    #     short-hint : Provide the scientific name of the species
    #     long-hint  : Provide the scientific name of the species, e.g., "Escherichia coli". This is important for taxonomy lookup.

    source:
        ui-name: Source of metagenome
        short-hint: |
            Source of the metagenome data (i.e. EBI etc.)
        long-hint: |
            Source of the metagenome data (i.e. EBI etc.)

    release :
        ui-name : Release or Version of the Source Data
        short-hint : |
            Release or version of the source data (for example: Release31, V4)
        long-hint : |
            Release or version of the source data (for example: Release31, V4)

    taxon_wsname:
        ui-name: Taxon Workspace Name
        short-hint: Where the reference taxons are. Defaults to ReferenceTaxons
        long-hint: Where the reference taxons are. Defaults to ReferenceTaxons

    taxon_id:
        ui-name: Taxonomy ID
        short-hint: Will try to link the Genome to the specified taxonomy id
        long-hint: If defined, will try to link the Genome to the specified taxonomy id in lieu of performing the lookup during upload

    genetic_code :
        ui-name : |
            Genetic Code for protein translation
        short-hint : |
            Valid genetic code (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi)
        long-hint : |
            Valid genetic code integer for translation purposes (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi)

    type:
        ui-name: Type
        short-hint: one of 'Reference', 'User upload', 'Representative'
        long-hint: one of 'Reference', 'User upload', 'Representative'

    generate_missing_genes :
        ui-name : |
            Spoof Genes for parentless CDS
        short-hint : |
            Generate gene feature for CDSs that do not have a parent in file
        long-hint : |
            Some files may contain only coding sequences but KBase genomes are
            expected to contain a parent gene for these CDS. This option
            generates spoof genes based on the CDS location.
